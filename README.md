# CODSOFT

## Overview

This repository contains three data science projects completed during a one-month remote internship at CODSOFT. The projects are implemented using Python, and each project focuses on a specific aspect of data science.

## Projects

### 1. IRIS Flower Classification

**Description:** This project involves the classification of IRIS flowers based on their features using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to accurately predict the species of an IRIS flower given its sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab


### 2. Sales Prediction

**Description:** The Sales Prediction project aims to forecast future sales based on historical data. Various regression models and time-series analysis techniques are employed to predict sales trends and patterns, providing valuable insights for decision-making.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Time Series Analysis
- Google Colab

### 3. Titanic Survival Prediction

**Description:** This project focuses on predicting the survival probability of passengers on the Titanic using machine learning algorithms. The dataset includes passenger information such as age, gender, class, and fare, and the model predicts whether a passenger survived or not.

**Technologies Used:**
- Python
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab
## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/me-sajal/CODSOFT.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd CODSOFT
   ```

3. Explore each project in its respective directory (`IRIS_Flower_Classification`, `Sales_Prediction`, `Titanic_Survival_Prediction`) to access the source code, datasets, and documentation.

## Acknowledgments
